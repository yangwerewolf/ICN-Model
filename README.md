# ICN-Model
This project implementated the analytical models for estimating the delay distribution and storage ratio, which are proposed in following papers:

J. Yang, Y. Sun, and J. Requena Carrion, ``An Analytical Model for Information Centric Internet of Things Networks in Opportunistic Scenarios,'' *IEEE Systems Journal*, 2019, pp. 1-12.

J. Yang, Y. Sun, and J. Requena Carrion, ``Modelling the Delay Distribution of Information Centric Delay Tolerant Networks in Disaster Area, ''  *in Proc. of ACM MobileHealth 2017 (MobileHealth'2017)*, Chennai, India, Jul. 2017, pp. 1-6.

This scripts also contains the code for processing data obatained from simulation, comparing the analytical model and simulated data and generating diagrams for paper publication. 

The main scrpit is the storage_v3.mlx which is the MATLAB live script file. Setup the directories of data files and initial parameters, the script will do the rest of things. Functions used for different purpose are also included.
